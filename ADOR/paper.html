          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A procedure for identifying the optimum conditions (time of reaction, temperature, acidity etc) has been developed for the Assembly-Disassembly-Organisation-Reassembly (ADOR) process, which is a relatively new method for the preparation of high silica zeolites. The ADOR method is a complex process with different possible outcomes. Following the protocol will allow researchers to identify the different products that are possible from the reaction without recourse to repetitive and time-consuming trial and error. In developing the protocol, germanium-containing UTL zeolites were subjected to hydrolysis conditions using both water and hydrochloric acid as media, which allows one to understand the effects of temperature and pH on the Disassembly (D) and Organisation (O) steps of the process that define the potential products. Samples were taken from the ongoing reaction periodically over 8 hours and each sample was analysed by powder X-ray diffraction to yield a time course for the reaction at each set of conditions, with selected samples analysed by transmission electron microscopy and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

        <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeolites are an important class of microporous solid that are widely used in industry. They are one of the most important families of heterogeneous catalysts in use today, but are also used in a wide variety of other applications from ion exchange and water softening through to medical applications. The Assembly-Disassembly-Organization-Reassembly (ADOR) process<a href="#bibliography"><sup>1-7</sup></a> is a new method of preparing this important class of compound. It differs from traditional zeolite synthesis processes, which generally involve reversible crystallization under hydrothermal conditions, in that the final framework-forming step is an irreversible condensation. The consequence of this is that materials with unexpected energetic properties can be prepared using the ADOR that are unlikely to be possible using the traditional methods.<a href="#bibliography"><sup>1</sup></a><br/><br/>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key feature required for the success of the ADOR method is the structure and chemistry of the parent zeolite that is assembled in the first step of the process. The research so far has concentrated on parents that have silica-rich layers linked by germanium-rich cubic units, termed double four ring (d4r) units. Generally, these d4r units contain approximately 50% Ge and 50% Si. There are several known zeolite topologies with the features that have been successfully used in the ADOR process. These include UTL,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>1,4-5</sup></a>ITH,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>8</sup></a> ITR,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>8</sup></a> IWR,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>8</sup></a> IWW,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>9</sup></a> UOV10,<a href="#bibliography"><sup>11</sup></a> and the recently discovered SAZ-1.12<br/><br/>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ADOR process is extremely flexible, and starting from only one parent zeolite with the UTL framework topology one can prepare a family of six new zeolites, named IPC-2, IPC-4, IPC-6, IPC-7, IPC-9 and IPC-10. Such diversity of outcomes points to a complex mechanism that must be understood if the full potential of the process is to be realised. The different outcomes are also very much dependent on the conditions used, and it is therefore very easy to miss potential products by not surveying enough of the potential conditions. To avoid this possibility, we have developed a standard protocol through which a wide range of conditions is tested. Here we present this protocol using zeolite UTL as an archetypal parent zeolite.

        </p>
        <h4 class="subheading">Design and overview of the procedure</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The ADOR process (Figure 1) has four main steps: formation of the pre-determined parent zeolite containing the required properties (Assembly); regioselective removal of the Ge-rich d4r by exploiting the chemical weakness within to produce a layered species (Disassembly); a reorganization or re-intercalation step where the layers are brought into the correct orientation for reconnection (Organization); formation of new Si-O-Si bonds between the layers to produce new daughter zeolites after subsequent calcination (Reassembly).<a href="#bibliography"><sup>5</sup></a>

            <p class="col-md-6"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A schematic diagram highlighting the four steps of the ADOR process. Initial d4r-containing parent zeolite UTL is broken down through hydrolysis, to make the layered intermediate IPC-1P. These layers are organised (or self-organise) before the Si-O-Si bonds are reformed through calcination to form a reassembled material with a different structure from the original assembled parent.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          The procedure presented here concentrates on identifying the intermediates that result from the D and O stages in the process, as it is these stages that really control the nature of the final product. There are three main variables that have to be controlled: time, temperature, and acidity of the disassembly medium. If one is to recognise all possible outcomes from the ADOR process it is important that enough parameter space is sampled to identify all possibilities. On the other hand, we want to make sure that the protocol is efficient in terms of time. By considering this balance, we have designed a protocol that uses four different disassembly media (water, 1.5 M HCl, 6M HCl and 12 M HCl) and temperatures that range between room temperature and 100 °C. It is also important to develop a simple method by which to monitor the progress of the ADOR process as it proceeds. As the samples taken during the course of the reaction are crystalline (or semi-crystalline) powder X-ray diffraction is an appropriate tool to study samples that are recovered from the reaction as it progresses. In particular, the d-spacing at which the 200 reflection appears in the X-ray diffraction pattern gives an excellent indication of the layer spacing in the material. The d200 value can then be plotted against time for each of the chosen conditions (temperature and acidity) to yield plots that are extremely informative in determining how the reaction is proceeding, and allowing us to identify the various steps in the process. Other techniques, such as solid-state NMR and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) can then be used as required to further characterize different samples.<br/><br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starting point for the protocol uses water as the disassembly (hydrolysis) medium and the reaction completed under reflux. The experiment is set up as shown in Figure 2 and as described in detail below. A 3-neck round-bottom flask is charged with the hydrolysis medium, and the system brought to the required temperature. The parent zeolite is added to the system and samples are taken of the solid material in the reaction at specified time intervals. These samples are analyzed using powder X-ray diffraction. The conditions used for the procedure can then be altered as required to find all possible products as demonstrated below.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheading">Extensions</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          While this protocol uses only Ge-UTL as the parent zeolite, it is designed so that any parent zeolite can be substituted in its place. This will be particularly useful as new parent zeolites are discovered, as the protocol will provide evidence quickly as to whether the ADOR process can be successfully applied or not.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheading">Limitations</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Given our knowledge of the ADOR process at the present time it is likely that this protocol will give good information on the disassembly stage of the process, as this generally happens quickly and at low temperature. However, for parent zeolites other than UTL the reinteraclation/rearrangment step might not occur at a rate that is probed by this protocol on sensible timescales. If higher temperatures are required then a new set up using hydrothermal equipment may be necessary.

        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reaction in water at 100 ºC</strong> As described above, samples of the solid in the reaction are taken at regular intervals from the reaction and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns measured for each sample. Figure 3 shows selected shows selected PXRD patterns and the inset shows how the position of the 200 reflection varies with time during the reaction. The patterns chosen correspond to the three main intermediates in the ADOR process for UTL: IPC-1P, IPC-2P and IPC-6P. Figure 4 then shows a plot of the time dependency of the d-spacing of the 200 reflection for all the samples. The plot shows that the parent Ge-UTL zeolite (d200 = 14.48 Å) is quickly disassembled (hydrolysis and removal of the Ge-rich d4r units) leading to a contraction of the interlayer distance. After 30 minutes or so the change in d200 levels off at just over 10.5 Å, which corresponds to the IPC-1P intermediate (Figure 1) where all the d4r units have been removed from between the layers. At first sight one might imagine that the reaction might be over at this time. However, the importance of following the procedure for a significant time is obvious as at longer times further changes occur. There is an induction period, during which IPC-1P is the only product identified in the reaction. After 120 minutes (under these conditions) the d200 value starts to increase again until it plateaus at a value of ~11.75 Å, which corresponds to IPC-2P (Figure 1), the compound where some extra silicon has been incorporated back into the interlayer space through a reintercalation/reorganisation reaction. Following this protocol also allows one to identify the time at the mid-point in the reintercalation process. This is the intermediate IPC-6P, which is the material where half of the layers have undergone the intercalation and half have not. This is a very unusual structure that is fully described in reference <a href="#bibliography">14</a> and whatever the parent zeolite is, it is worth identifying the conditions needed to form this particular intermediate.

              <strong>Figure 4.</strong> A plot of the variation of d-spacing of the <i>200</i> PXRD reflection versus time for the ADOR reaction carried out in water at 100 °C. The plot shows clearly the different regions of the process. The disassembly of the parent Ge-UTL zeolite happens quickly and is complete inside 1 hour. There follows an induction period where IPC-1P is the only identifiable product. Following this a new process occurs where the d-spacing increases, finally forming a different product, IPC-2P. The coloured symbols show the samples whose full PXRD patterns are shown in Figure 3. The precision in the measurement of the PXRD d spacing is within the symbols on the diagram.

        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hydrolysis and rearrangement steps for Ge-UTL at 100 ºC were further analysed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and TEM. Samples were taken when major structural changes had taken place: 1 min (a sample that we call Ge-IPC-2P* because it has the same d<sub>200</sub> value as IPC-2P), 1 hr (IPC-1P), 4 & 8 hr (IPC-2P). A sample at 8 hr was taken to verify that the reaction had concluded after 4 hr and no other structural changes had occured.<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using <sup>29</sup>Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, the relative change in both Q<sup>4</sup> (Si(OSi)<sub>4</sub>) and Q<sup>3</sup> (Si(OSi)<sub>3</sub>(OH)) species can be monitored over time (Figure 5). The growth of the Q<sup>3</sup> peak after 1 hr, suggests the formation of silanol (Si-OH) groups in the layered species, IPC-1P. After 1 hr the Q<sup>3</sup> peak reduces in intensity as they rearrange to Q<sup>4</sup> sites in accordance with Figure 1.<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an initial hydrolysis at 1 hr, the ratio of Q<sup>3</sup>:Q<sup>4</sup> sites is 1:2.3, thus close to the ideal ratio of 1:2.5 for IPC-1P. The Q<sup>3</sup>:Q<sup>4</sup> ratio continues to decrease as the rearrangement process occurs, leading to a ratio of 1:4.75 upon formation of IPC-2P at 4 hr (ideal IPC-2P Q<sup>3</sup>:Q<sup>4</sup> = 1:7). Due to the relative difference between actual and ideal ratios, we can conclude that some silanol groups remain as defects throughout the material. Analytical fitting of the spectrum of the one minute sample, recorded after 87 days (12.5 weeks) (Fig. 3. ESI), produces a Q<sup>3</sup>:Q<sup>4</sup> of 1:3.89 – an increase from 1:3.29 when the sample was recorded directly after hydrolysis. This supports previous findings<sup><a href="#bibliography">15</a></sup> which show that although the interlayer spacing of the IPC-2P solid remains constant after hydrolysis and drying, some atomic-level rearrangements in the interlayer regions may still be occurring.<br/>

        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TEM images highlight a loss of some crystallinity from parent Ge-UTL over the course of 1 min (Fig. 7. ESI). These structures are highly unstable during radiation. However, a clear drop in d spacing can be seen over the first hr (IPC-1P), before increasing again to form IPC-2P, again corroborating the XRD data.

        <h4 class="subheading">The Effect of Temperature</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hydrolysis and rearrangement mechanisms of Ge-UTL through the ADOR process were investigated over a period of 8 hr using water as the hydrolysis medium at six different temperatures (100, 92, 85, 81, 77 and 70 ºC). Figure 6 shows the change in d spacing with time for all these temperatures. The initial hydrolysis is rapid at higher temperatures (100, 92, 85, 81, 77, 70 ºC) occurring over the course of 1 hr. Several features can immediately be identified. First, it is clear that the initially disassembly is fast under all conditions. Indeed, it is so fast that the errors associated in accurate measurement of the time are likely to be significant, and limit any quantitative conclusions that can be elucidated from the data for this process. Second is that the induction period varies greatly with temperature; as the temperature of the reaction is lowered the induction period increases. Third the rate of the reintercalation/reorganisation step increases with temperature. Clearly, there is the possibly of quantifying reaction rates and apparent activation energies using these data, but this is beyond the scope of this protocol paper. However, the data does give excellent qualitative information that helps to show which particular set of conditions might be the optimum for the preparation of the desired product, IPC-1P, IPC-6P or IPC-2P.

After 1 min at 100, 82, 85. 81 and 70 °C, Ge-UTL is hydrolysed to Ge-IPC-2P*, before being hydrolysed further to IPC-1P. Ge-UTL is rearranged to IPC-2P at 2 hr (100 °C), 3 hr (92 °C) and 4.5 hr (85 °C), with 81 °C, 77 °C (not shown) and 70 °C remaining as IPC-1P throughout the 8 hr.

        <h4 class="subheading">The Effect of pH</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hydrolysis and rearrangement mechanisms of Ge-UTL were further investigated by varying the concentration of hydrochloric acid (12, 6, 1.5 and 0.1 M). The temperature was kept constant at 20 ºC to solely monitor the effect of acid strength (Figure 7).<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactions undertaken in strong acid (12 and 6 M) were rapid, with both the hydrolysis and rearrangement occurring simultaneously. In othr words the induction period is reduced to zero and the disassembly never has time to complete before rearrangement occurs and IPC-2P is formed. In 1.5 and 0.1 M HCl, the reaction is much slower and a full hydrolysis to IPC-1P can be seen.

The reaction is rapid in both 12 and 6 M HCl, leading to IPC-6P and IPC-2P, respectively. For reactions in 0.1 and 1.5 M HCl, the reaction is slightly slower with the full hydrolysis to the layered material IPC-1P seen over the course of 1 hr.
