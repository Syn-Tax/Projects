        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microporous materials are an important class of solid; the two main members of this family are zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Zeolites are industrial solids whose applications range from catalysis, through ion exchange and adsorption technologies to medicine. MOFs are some of the most exciting new materials to have been developed over the last two decades, and they are just beginning to be applied commercially.<br/><br/>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over recent years the applicant’s group has developed new synthetic strategies to prepare microporous materials, including the Assembly-Disassembly-Organisation-Reassembly (ADOR) process. In significant preliminary work the ADOR process has shown to be an extremely important new synthetic methodology that differs fundamentally from traditional solvothermal methods.<br/><br/>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project I will look to overturn the conventional thinking in materials science by developing methodologies that can target both zeolites and MOF materials that are difficult to prepare using traditional methods – the so-called ‘unfeasible’ materials. The importance of such a new methodology is that it will open up routes to materials that have different properties (both chemical and topological) to those we currently have. Since zeolites and MOFs have so many actual and potential uses, the preparation of materials with different properties has a high chance of leading to new technologies in the medium/long term. To complete the major objectives of the programme I will look to complete four closely linked activities covering the development of design strategies for zeolites and MOFs (activities 1 & 2), mechanistic studies to understand the process at the molecular level using in situ characterisation techniques (activity 3) and an exploration of potential applied science for the prepared materials (activity 4).<br/>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microporous materials, including zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), make up one of the most important class of inorganic and inorganic-organic hybrid material in current research. In recent years the journal Science1 listed the development of new zeolitic solids as one of the ten most important areas of current science and MOFs are recognised as one of the most exciting classes of compound to have been developed over the last couple of decades; their commercial applications are currently being developed in several areas. Microporous materials have ongoing or potential applications across some of the most important areas of technology; from heterogeneous catalysis, through gas storage and separations for energy applications and other important processes all the way to medical therapies and biological applications. However, the development of new technologies depends critically on our ability to prepare new materials with unique properties.<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main hypothesis in this project is based on the recognition that traditional synthetic methods intrinsically limit the types of material that are accessible. The main aims are:<br/>
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>to develop new methods that overturn the conventional thinking in microporous materials synthesis and develop routes to new materials that are not only novel, but that cannot be prepared using current methods. </li>
          <li>to demonstrate that the materials have unique properties that differentiate them from traditionally prepared materials, opening up potential impact in several different areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary groundwork that underpins this proposal has resulted in high profile publications in Nature Chemistry,2-5 Angewandte Chemie6-8 and J. Am. Chem. Soc.9 and not only illustrates that the general concept is feasilble, but also shows that the resultant materials do indeed have unique properties, such as tuneable porosity and unusual toplogies (zeolites) and increased stability (MOFs). This preliminary work considerably derisks the application as a whole by demonstrating its feasibility while also illustrating the transformative nature of the materials that can be produced.

        <h4 class="subheading">What is the ADOR process?</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ADOR (Assembly-Disassembly-Organisation-Reassembly) mechanism2-9 is a new method of zeolite manipulation where the selective disassembly of a pre-prepared parent followed by reassembly can lead to new topologies (Figure 2). The key feature of the parent is the presence of a ‘weakness’ in the material that can be selectively manipulated. For zeolites this is a hydrolytically sensitive dopant element, especially Ge but it could be other elements like Zn, incorporated within the framework at a specific site, which allows the chemically selective removal of the units containing the dopant. We can then exploit this weakness by taking the material apart again and reassembling it into a new structure. The original use of the ADOR mechanism was published in Nature Chemistry,2 with follow up papers in Angewandte Chemie,6,7 followed by a perspective explaining how important the process might be.3 Subsequent developments led to further papers in Nature Chemistry.4,5 Despite this very successful early work there are many questions that remain unanswered. Prime amongst these revolve around the mechanism of the process, and how knowledge of the mechanism can then aid in the synthesis of important new materials with hitherto unknown properties. A key point about the ADOR mechanism is that because the building blocks are disassembled from a fully 3D connected parent, they are geometrically perfect for reassembly into the new materials. This is not necessarily true for directly synthesised layered materials. While much of our preliminary work has concentrated on zeolites, our recent research has shown that the ADOR concept can equally be applied to MOFs; although, of course, the differences in chemistry between MOFs and zeolites means that the actual chemical processes are different, the basic underlying concept is equivalent for both types of material.

The lower panel shows how this concept can be applied to zeolites. Assembling a UTL parent, before dissassembly into layered building blocks (we call this material IPC-1P). The key step is then how to organise these layers with reassembly into new materials. Different organisations lead to the different possible final zeolites, in this case IPC-4 and IPC-9.

        <h4 class="subheading">Objectives</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve the major goals of the overall programme listed above the following research objectives must be met. During the course of the research programme we will:</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Demonstrate that the ADOR methodology can be extended across a wide range of silica and aluminosilicate zeolites, developing a coherent synthetic strategy targeting unfeasible zeolites.</li>
          <li>Extend the applicability of the ADOR process to other metal-organic frameworks.</li>
          <li>Demonstrate that the properties of the materials are distinct from those made using traditional methods. For example, in zeolites we will be looking to target new topologies (e.g. odd membered rings, 7,9,11 etc.) and for MOFs significantly enhanced stability when no such stability is expected.</li>
          <li>Understand the mechanism of the processes involved using in situ characterisation experiments. As part of this objective we will also be looking at high-level characterisation of the final materials and any intermediates that can be isolated. </li>
          <li>Explore potential applications by making the process more ‘industry friendly’ and exploiting the different properties that we expect from the materials as listed in objective 3 above. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="subheading">What are the significance, vision and ambition of the research?</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision that underpins this proposed project is that materials synthesis can be transformed through the realisation that many potentially important solids are inaccessible using traditional synthetic methods. The overall project is extremely ambitious in that it looks to overturn conventional thinking in experimental design approaches to novel materials preparation, as well as delivering fundamental understanding of the processes and developing potential impact by demonstrating that new types of material with unique properties can be prepared. This is extremely significant in the microporous materials area in particular as it will deliver new solids that are different to those we currently have – opening up new avenues for application that are not currently possible.</p>
        <h4 class="subheading">Why is the research ground breaking?</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real ground-breaking aspect of this proposal is the realisation that many structures previously labelled as ‘unfeasible’ can now be targeted. The major outcome will be both a new general concept and new materials. As a concept, the ADOR process also differs fundamentally from the vast majority of synthesis concepts. In general, in materials science we use kinetic control to avoid the thermodynamic product of a reaction. However, zeolites (in particular) are generally viewed already as kinetic products. In the ADOR process we actually use thermodynamic control in the organisation part of the ADOR process to avoid kinetic control – the exact opposite of the general thinking in the area. This will be explained more fully in the extended project description.

        <h4 class="subheading">Why are some materials described as 'unfeasible'? - The zeolite conundrum!</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeolite structures comprise tetrahedral units, TO4 (where T can be a variety of elements), which are fully linked through their vertices into three-dimensional, porous networks. By far the most important zeolites are those comprising predominantly silicon-based tetrahedra, with aluminium replacing a proportion of the silicon. There are about 50 known pure/high silica materials out of just over 200 known zeolite frameworks of all possible compositions.10 However, simulations suggest that there are millions of possible (hypothetical) silicon-based zeolite topologies.11 This is the zeolite conundrum – why can we make so few of the possible structures?12  It has long been recognised that the known zeolites show a strong correlation between framework energy and density; a finding that was predicted computationally and confirmed experimentally.13 This means that all the solvothermally synthesised silica-based zeolites lie on this energy-density correlation (Shown in Figure 1 as the red line). Michael Deem (Rice University, USA) calls materials to the right of red line diagonal correlation ‘unfeasible’.4,14,15

        <p class="paragraph">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the set of hypothetical zeolites do not show such a correlation and indeed the potential structures cover a large region in energy-density space (Figure 1).11 A recent revelation in the field predicted that the energy-density correlation is not due to any intrinsic property of the solid, but is caused by limitations of the hydrothermal synthesis procedures (and specifically its reversible crystallisation).3,4,14 This means that new, fundamentally different  synthetic mechanisms might not be limited by the same restrictions. In preliminary work we showed that this was true and that by developing a new synthetic method (the ADOR process) we could make new zeolites by first making a parent and then postsynthetically modifying it under conditions that avoid the limitations of hydrothermal synthesis. A full explanation of why this route can access the ‘unfeasible’ areas of the plot can be found in reference 4.<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly, we also predict4,14 that the materials that currently reside in the inaccessible area of the energy-density plot will have different structural features from traditionally made zeolites (e.g. odd membered ring openings), which will lead to unique diffusion and selectivity properties, that may open up new applications (See reference 14 for a description of why this is likely to be true). <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the interesting features about the ADOR process in zeolites is that we take a hydrolytically unstable germanosilicate parent and turn it into a hydrolytically stable, and therefore potentially useful, daughter zeolite. MOFs also follow a similar energy-density correlation16 and one of the objectives of this proposal is to explore whether similar ‘unfeasible’ MOFs are possible. Our preliminary work in this area has also been spectacularly successful, and using the ADOR approach for MOFs has resulted in a potential solution to the problem of poor MOF hydrolytic stability. This work has been submitted to Nature Chemistry.
